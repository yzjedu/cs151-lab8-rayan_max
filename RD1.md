We were supposed to learn how to code using while loops, functions, lists and random numbers. The way we got there was from having notes in this stuff. Just going over it again and again till we finnaly got it. The results did match as we expected. We did not do test cases becuase they were not prompted for this assignment. Main challenges would be when we were trying to figure out if we should add 2 dice rolls together in a function or just 1 from 2,12. Example adding two 1,6 versus just doing 1 2,12. Another challenge was the printing of the stars part. For the first three rules of programming we just kepting working whenver we found a challenge. Listening to eachother. Not really any key takeaways. Partner was great. He was able to help me in so many ways with some things I did not understand. Max is a cool guy.
