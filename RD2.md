What was it like working with your partner?

- A challenged we encountered was learning how to properly increment a list. First we kept on getting an error saying 
- saying value was not in index. We solved this problem by looking back in our zybooks to learn how we would need to subtract
- 2 at certain places which why we had to do that still is difficult for me to understand. We also struggled with error checking
- until we finally used a while not loop which help us error check our code. We learned about incrementing in our code and 
- how to print out each value in a list. Working with Rayan went well, we communicated well and we both learned alot from 
- eachother, this PA was difficult but with collaboration I was able to learn a lot.
